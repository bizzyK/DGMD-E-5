            <!-- Summary paragraph -->
            <p><strong>Project Summary:</strong> <em>Our River: Picking Up the Story</em> is a multimedia documentary
                project designed to relaunch and support the completion of a film originally begun by my father.
                Interrupted
                by COVID and family illness, the project had been paused for years until I stepped in to carry the story
                forward. The film explores the cultural, ecological, and personal significance of the Connecticut River,
                combining original video, still photography, and narrative voiceover into a short documentary embedded
                in
                this site.</p>
            <!-- Reflection paragraph -->
            <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> This project evolved significantly from my original expectations. The
                technical
                demands of filming, editing, and web deployment—especially while coordinating remotely with my
                father—proved
                more challenging than anticipated. However, building the site and shaping the emotional arc of the video
                came more naturally than I expected. I’ve learned that storytelling isn't just about media—it’s about
                intention and clarity of message. While not all content is final yet, the structure and purpose are
                solidly
                in place, and I look forward to replacing placeholders with polished materials in time for submission.
