    <h2>Presentation Introduction Video</h2>
    <p>This video serves as an introduction to the final project. It is a recorded presentation where I explain the origins, process, and intended impact of the documentary project. This is not the final documentary itself, but a personal walkthrough meant to replicate presenting in class.</p>

    <h2>Final Project Write-Up</h2>
    <p><strong>Project Summary:</strong> <em>Our River: Picking Up the Story</em> is a multimedia documentary project designed to relaunch and support the completion of a film originally begun by my father. Interrupted by COVID and family illness, the project had been paused for years until I stepped in to carry the story forward. The film explores the cultural, ecological, and personal significance of the Connecticut River, combining original video, still photography, and narrative voiceover into a short documentary embedded in this site.</p>
    <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> This project evolved significantly from my original expectations. The technical demands of filming, editing, and web deployment—especially while coordinating remotely with my father—proved more challenging than anticipated. However, building the site and shaping the emotional arc of the video came more naturally than I expected. I’ve learned that storytelling isn't just about media—it’s about intention and clarity of message. While not all content is final yet, the structure and purpose are solidly in place, and I look forward to replacing placeholders with polished materials in time for submission.</p>
