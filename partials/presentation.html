    <p><strong>Final Project Write-Up:</strong></p>

    <p><em>“The Connecticut: Our River”</em> is a documentary originally envisioned and begun by my father, Vincent Hogan. It explores the environmental and cultural significance of the Connecticut River through interviews, personal storytelling, and original footage. Filming began in 2019, but was paused due to the COVID-19 pandemic, followed by two cancer diagnoses in our immediate family and additional medical setbacks. The camera was put down, but the story remained.</p>

    <p>This project—<em>Our River: Picking Up the Story</em>—was created for DGMD E-5 to reintroduce that vision and begin the work of completing it. As executive producer, I launched this site as the first phase of a broader initiative: to raise funds, build awareness, and reconnect with the river’s story. The site includes early documentary footage, photography, and a narrated video introducing the initiative—all crafted to re-establish momentum around the project. I also founded a nonprofit initiative under <a href="https://www.feane.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FEANE Charities</a> to provide the legal and operational infrastructure needed to see this through.</p>

    <p>Building the website was more technically demanding than I expected, especially integrating video and designing for responsiveness. Coordinating materials between myself and my father, who filmed the original footage, also presented some emotional and logistical challenges. Weather also limited my ability to capture all the new footage I had planned, though I was able to gather aerial footage from my father, source archival content online, and sift through my own phone for behind-the-scenes photos taken over the past few years of the project. But what came more easily was the storytelling itself. Once I began narrating, the words flowed. This was not just a school assignment—it was a deeply personal creative process.</p>

    <p>While the full documentary is still in development, this site marks a clear step forward. It represents not just the relaunch of a paused project, but the beginning of something much bigger: a platform for environmental storytelling, legacy preservation, and regional education. It’s more than a website—it’s an invitation to help finish what was started.</p>
