    <h2>Educate. Inspire. Advocate.</h2>
    <p>
        Our River Initiative is dedicated to raising awareness and protecting the Connecticut River through the power of documentary storytelling, community engagement, and intergenerational education. We believe that telling the story of the river—its history, its people, and its ecological importance—can inspire lasting stewardship.

    <h2>A Story Rooted in Family</h2>
    <p>
        The initiative began as a personal project by Vincent Hogan in 2019, and is now being shepherded to completion by his daughter, Elizabeth Koch, as executive producer. This film project is more than a documentary—it's a living archive and a tribute to the connection between family, memory, and place.

    <h2>Connecting Communities with Conservation</h2>
    <p>
        We aim to empower local schools, families, and environmental groups with engaging resources and community screenings that bring the river’s story to life. With your support, we plan to complete the documentary and use it to promote ecological awareness and inspire intergenerational stewardship through education and storytelling.

    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The Connecticut River supplies drinking water to over 2 million people.</li>
        <li>It’s home to endangered species, Indigenous heritage sites, and fragile ecosystems.</li>
        <li>Restoration projects are underfunded and often invisible to the public.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This initiative bridges environmental awareness with cultural memory—one story, one stream at a time.
