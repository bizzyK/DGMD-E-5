        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>“Our River: Picking Up the Story” is more than a class project—it's a personal commitment to finish what my
            father began. My dad, Vincent Hogan, started documenting the Connecticut River to preserve its cultural,
            ecological, and historical legacy. When life derailed those plans—first through the pandemic, and then
            through cancer diagnoses in our family—I realized that the story couldn't end there.</p>

        <p>This digital media project represents the first step in picking up that story. Through original photography,
            a short video, and reflective storytelling, I aim to reintroduce the Connecticut River’s significance and
            build momentum toward completing the full-length documentary he envisioned. It’s also the public launch of a
            new 501(c)(3) nonprofit dedicated to continuing this mission and raising awareness for the river’s
            future.</p>

        <p>The process has been deeply personal—revisiting my father’s footage, walking the riverbanks we once explored
            together, and translating our shared vision into a format that invites others to join the journey. This
            website marks the beginning of something bigger: a renewed effort to honor the past, protect the river, and
            finish the story we started as a family.</p>
