    <h2>“The Connecticut: Our River”</h2>
    <p>
      “The Connecticut: Our River” is a documentary film originally envisioned and started by Vincent Hogan. It captures the beauty, history, and challenges of New England’s longest river through footage, interviews, and personal storytelling. Though filming began in 2019, the project was paused due to the COVID-19 pandemic, followed by cancer diagnoses in two immediate family members and other medical setbacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, the Our River Initiative is an effort to honor that legacy and bring the film to completion. Led by executive producer Elizabeth Koch, this initiative aims to raise the necessary funds and support to finish the documentary and share it with communities across the region and beyond.
