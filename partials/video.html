            <!-- Summary paragraph -->
            <p><em>The Connecticut: Our River</em> is a documentary film that depicts
                the natural wonder of the river from its source in Canada, along its journey through four New England
                states, to its meeting with the salt water of Long Island Sound. The personal and professional
                reflections of interviewees enlighten and engage viewers in the battle for a clean Connecticut River. It
                emphasizes the ongoing struggle to maintain and improve river quality and access. The film balances the
                pristine beauty of the river against the pollution, invasive species, sewage runoff, garbage dumps, and
                dead beat dams that spoil the river and threaten its future.</p>
