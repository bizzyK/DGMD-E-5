            <h3>Project Summary</h3>
            <!-- Summary paragraph -->
            <p><em>Our River: Picking Up the Story</em> is a multimedia documentary project created to relaunch and
                support the completion of <em>The Connecticut: Our River</em>, a film originally begun by my father. His
                documentary follows the Connecticut River from its source in Canada to Long Island Sound, focusing on
                the balance between natural beauty and environmental degradation. My project continues that mission by
                highlighting the moment I chose to step in and carry the story forward after his work was paused by
                health and family challenges. Through new video, photography, and personal storytelling, I aim to
                reengage audiences and lay the foundation for a nonprofit dedicated to securing funding and visibility
                for the filmâ€™s completion.</p>
