    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>“Our River: Picking Up the Story” is more than a class project—it's a personal commitment to finish what my father began. My dad, Vincent Hogan, started documenting the Connecticut River to preserve its cultural, ecological, and historical legacy. When life derailed those plans—first through the pandemic, and then through cancer diagnoses in our family—I realized that the story couldn't end there.</p>

    <p>This digital media project represents the first step in picking up that story. Through original photography, a short video, and reflective storytelling, I aim to reintroduce the Connecticut River’s significance and build momentum toward completing the full-length documentary he envisioned. It’s also the public launch of a new 501(c)(3) nonprofit dedicated to continuing this mission and raising awareness for the river’s future.</p>

    <p>The process has been deeply personal—revisiting my father’s footage, walking the riverbanks we once explored together, and translating our shared vision into a format that invites others to join the journey. This website marks the beginning of something bigger: a renewed effort to honor the past, protect the river, and finish the story we started as a family.</p>
